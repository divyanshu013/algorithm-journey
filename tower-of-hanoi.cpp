Problem
=======
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying
the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing
   it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost
   disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm
=========
1) Move the top (n - 1) disks from Source to Aux tower.
2) Move the nth disk from Source to Destination.
3) Move the (n - 1) disks from Aux tower to Destination.
4) Solve recursively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity
===============
O(2^n)
For n disks, total (2^n â€“ 1) moves are required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output
======
Move Disk 1 from A to C
Move Disk 2 from A to B
Move Disk 1 from C to B
Move Disk 3 from A to C
Move Disk 1 from B to A
Move Disk 2 from B to C
Move Disk 1 from A to C
